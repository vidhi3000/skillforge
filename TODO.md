# TODO: Correct CSS in src/index.css

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Update :root in @layer base to include standard Shadcn/ui CSS variables for neutral base color (e.g., --background, --foreground, --card, --card-foreground, etc.)
- [ ] Fix the standalone * selector to apply @apply border-border;
- [ ] Combine the two @layer base blocks into a single block for better organization
- [ ] Verify the updated CSS file for syntax correctness and ensure it aligns with Shadcn/ui conventions
